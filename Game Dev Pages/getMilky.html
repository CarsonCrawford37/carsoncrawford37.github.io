						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
							Get Milky is a local multiplayer, hide-and-seek game where there are two players: the cowboy
							and the cow. Setting place on a farm, the cowboy is trying to seek the cow amongst the herd
							- essentially trying to find a needle in a haystack. The player who is the cow looks just
							like all the other cows in the herd, requiring the player to be focused on their position
							all while looking out for the other player. This causes mass confusion for both players,
							enabling a fun and hectic experience. We also aimed to make this game as inclusive as
							possible, so we created a custom controller for individuals with limited motor capabilities.
							Using an Arduino Uno, we conceived, designed, and successfully implemented the controller
							into our game.

						<h3>My Contributions</h3>
						<p>I worked as the main functionality programmer, developing all the game mechanics such as
							intuitive <b>movement controls</b>, <b>AI state machines</b>, <b>round systems</b>, and
							<b>multiplayer</b>. I also helped conceptualize the game by including features like the
							isometric view and hide-and-seek aspect.<br>

								<p>
									<b>Movement -</b><br>
									Movement is everything in games. In this project, we wanted a very specific feel to
									how
									the players run around the pen, almost like a slippery feel for increased chaotic
									gameplay. For this, I used the player’s rigid body and added force when they moved,
									simulating the sliding feel. With multi-controller compatibility in mind (including
									the
									custom Arduino controller), I used Unity’s input manager to gather any input and
									register it as movement.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>AI -</b><br>
									As a key feature, the AI acts as a moving barrier for the players, creating a more
									engaging gameplay. For this, I used navmesh agents and a simple state machine to
									bring
									them to life. The state machine only had two states (sleeping and working) however,
									it
									was equipped for many more actions. This just had the AI walk to a random point,
									stop
									for a random amount of time, and then walk to another random point to start over. We
									also wanted to randomly spawn the cows inside the pen, so I created a min and max
									bounds
									to keep them within the pen and then spawned them individually.
								</p>

								<p>
									<b>Round System</b><br>
									This was the main meat of the game that determined the win conditioning. I
									programmed this
									system so that if the timer ends before the cowboy catches the cow, then the cow
									wins, and
									vice versa.
								</p>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="demo of the the tutorial"
										alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>Multiplayer</b><br>
									I used Unity’s Simple Multiplayer package to allow multiple players to join via the
									same
									machine. I also designed an auto-player prefab assignment script where it will
									automatically
									give the player a role based on when they join.

					<!-- <p>Alzheimer's is a very difficult disease to catch early on, due to how similar they are to the symptoms of normal aging. However, recent studies have identified a correlation between a diminishing sense of smell and Alzheimer's. In response to this need for early detection tools, a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) class at Boise State University took on the challenge. Leveraging the immersive nature of virtual reality technology and a custom-built scent device, <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/vip/brain-health-vr-scent/" target="empty"><b>BrainHealthVR</b></a> designed a cost-effective testing simulation to aid in the pre-diagnosis of this degenerative disease that regular doctors can use with ease.</p> -->

						<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/XR/Alzheimers/AlzheimersTut.gif"
							alt="demo of the the tutorial" alt="" /></span>As a summer intern, I collaborated with a team of three to finalize the simulation for presentation to a partner company. This company had agreed to conduct initial tests of the program with their patients. My responsibility included ensuring the simulation was thoroughly prepared and ready for testing. This involved enhancing user interactions, optimizing communication between the scent device and the program, and coordinating	closely with the engineering team and client to deliver a polished product.</p>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/XR/Alzheimers/alzcover.png"
							alt="" /></span>One of my key responsibilities for ensuring smooth user interaction was to develop a tutorial specifically designed for individuals who may be unfamiliar with VR technology, mitigating the risk of unintended consequences such as cybersickness. This approach not only minimized the need for verbal instruction, which could exacerbate confusion but also significantly enhanced accessibility to the simulation, ultimately resulting in a more	inclusive and user-friendly experience for all participants.</p>
