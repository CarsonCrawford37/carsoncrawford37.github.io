						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
							Trapped in an underground cave system, the player discovers an ancient civilization -
							Bezza’lithia… As the player finds their way out to the surface, they learn about the lost
							magic that once resided there. Using the spells they learned, they must complete puzzles,
							battle the Stone Guardians, and solve the mystery of Bezza’lithia.

						<h3>My Contributions</h3>
						<p>This independent development project has challenged me to engage in all aspects of game
							development such as <b>game design</b>, <b>UX design</b>, <b>3D modeling/VFX</b>, and
							<b>programming</b>.
						<table>
							<tr>
								<span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic01.jpg" alt="demo of the the tutorial"
										alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<b>Game Design -</b><br>
									Conceived and designed a game design document (GDD) describing the backstory, key
									features, objectives, 3D assets, AI/characters, and future development plans.
									Concept photos are generated using Dalle 3.
								</p>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<b>UX Design -</b><br>
									I independently tested over 30 individuals for any game-breaking bugs, features that
									needed to be reworked, and accessibility inclusiveness.
								</p>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<span class="image left"><img src="../images/pic03.jpg" alt="demo of the the tutorial"
										alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<b>3D Modeling/VFX</b><br>
									I modeled and textured all assets using Blender and Adobe Substance Painter
									including the hand models, cave system, and environmental objects. I also created an
									animated shader for spell effects on objects.
								</p>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<span class="image right"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="demo of the the tutorial"
										alt="" /></span>
								<p><b>Programming</b><br>
									I wrote every script in the game as well as implemented a voice command-centered
									spell system, requiring the user to learn and pronounce the keyword correctly to be
									cast. For this I used the basic Windows Speech Recognition system to look for these
									words and then trigger a function.

					<!-- <p>Alzheimer's is a very difficult disease to catch early on, due to how similar they are to the symptoms of normal aging. However, recent studies have identified a correlation between a diminishing sense of smell and Alzheimer's. In response to this need for early detection tools, a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) class at Boise State University took on the challenge. Leveraging the immersive nature of virtual reality technology and a custom-built scent device, <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/vip/brain-health-vr-scent/" target="empty"><b>BrainHealthVR</b></a> designed a cost-effective testing simulation to aid in the pre-diagnosis of this degenerative disease that regular doctors can use with ease.</p> -->

					<!-- <section>
						<p><span class="image left"><img src="../images/XR/Alzheimers/AlzheimersTut.gif"
							alt="demo of the the tutorial" alt="" /></span>As a summer intern, I collaborated with a team of three to finalize the simulation for presentation to a partner company. This company had agreed to conduct initial tests of the program with their patients. My responsibility included ensuring the simulation was thoroughly prepared and ready for testing. This involved enhancing user interactions, optimizing communication between the scent device and the program, and coordinating	closely with the engineering team and client to deliver a polished product.</p>
						<p><span class="image right"><img src="../images/XR/Alzheimers/alzcover.png"
							alt="" /></span>One of my key responsibilities for ensuring smooth user interaction was to develop a tutorial specifically designed for individuals who may be unfamiliar with VR technology, mitigating the risk of unintended consequences such as cybersickness. This approach not only minimized the need for verbal instruction, which could exacerbate confusion but also significantly enhanced accessibility to the simulation, ultimately resulting in a more	inclusive and user-friendly experience for all participants.</p>
