						<h3>About</h3>
						<p>
							Trapped in an underground cave system, the player discovers an ancient civilization -
							Bezza’lithia… As the player finds their way out to the surface, they learn about the lost
							magic that once resided there. Using the spells they learned, they must complete puzzles,
							battle the Stone Guardians, and solve the mystery of Bezza’lithia.<br>
							Starting off as a school assignment that turned into a fun side project, I have been working
							on this game for about two and a half years now. Currently, there is only two puzzles in the
							first level as well as two spells with plans on reworking key features.

						<h3>My Contributions</h3>
						<p>This independent development project has challenged me to engage in all aspects of game
							development such as <b>game design</b>, <b>UX design</b>, <b>3D modeling/VFX</b>, and
							<b>programming</b>.

									<p>
										<b>Game Design -</b><br>
										Conceived and designed a game design document (GDD) describing the backstory,
										key
										features, objectives, 3D assets, AI/characters, and future development plans. I
										also
										have a basic layout of lore and environmental storytelling to add depth to the
										game.
										Concept photos are generated using Dalle-3.
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<p>
										<b>UX Design -</b><br>
										I independently tested over 30 individuals for any game-breaking bugs, features
										that
										needed to be reworked, and accessibility inclusiveness.
									</p>

								<td>
									<p>
										<b>3D Modeling/VFX - </b><br>
										I modeled and textured all assets using Blender and Adobe Substance Painter
										including the hand models, cave system, and environmental objects. I also
										created an
										animated shader for spell effects on objects.
									</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<p><b>Programming - </b><br>
										I wrote every script in the game as well as implemented a voice command-centered
										spell system, requiring the user to learn and pronounce the keyword correctly to
										be
										cast. For this I used the basic Windows Speech Recognition system to look for
										these words and then trigger a function.
